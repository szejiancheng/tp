### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
the </div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="700" />



The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Quick Access Buttons on Each Student Card

#### Motivation for Quick Access Buttons
When a `tutor` wants to view a `student's` profile, homework, lessons, or exams, they need to use the commandbax. However, the current ResultDisplay is purely text-based, making it difficult and time-consuming for `tutors` to access and digest the relevant information.

To address this issue, we propose the implementation of Quick Access Buttons on each `Student Card`. These buttons will provide tutors with easy and quick access to the relevant `student` information. By simply clicking on the appropriate button, tutors can view the `student's` profile, homework, lessons, or exams in a more informative and visually appealing way, complete with multiple diagrams or charts.

The inclusion of these Quick Access Buttons will not only improve the user experience for `tutors` but also save them valuable time that can be better spent on other aspects of their teaching. With the information at their fingertips, `tutors` will be better equipped to make informed decisions and provide personalized guidance to each student.

#### Implementation of Quick Access Buttons

Given below is the partial class diagram of `Ui` component related to Quick Access Buttons on the Student Card.

<img src="images/UiQuickAccessButton.png" width="600" height="600"/>

Each `Student Card` contains exactly four buttons `Profile`, `Homework`, `Lessons`, and `Exams`. Each of the buttons can generate a Special `DetailedContent`, which will be displayed in the `DetialedInfoSection` on the `MainWindow`

Given below is the partial class diagram of `Ui` component related to Detailed Information Section on the Student Card.

<img src="images/UiDetailedInfoSectionDiagram.png" width="1000" height="600"/>

The `DetailedInfoSection` is made up of a `HeaderBar`, displaying the type of the current `DetailedInfoSection` and the name of the `Student` to which the information belongs. `DetailedContent`component has five subclasses extending it, namely `WelcomeContent`, `ProfileContent`,  `GeneralHomeworkContent`,  `GeneralLessonsContent`, `GeneralExamsContent`. 

Given below is the partial class diagram of `Ui` component related to Profile Content.

<img src="images/UiProfileContent.png" width="600" height="600"/>

Given below is the sequence diagram showing how the action of clicking the `ProfileButton` of a `Student` creates a new `ProfileContent` for that particular student

<img src="images/ProfileClickSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" height="600" />

**How the Profile Section is created when Profile Button is Clicked**

1. Based on the graph above, after the user clicks the view profile button, `StudentCard` calls `Student#getFullName()`, which then calls `Name#getFirstName()`.
2. `StudentCard` then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledHeaderBar()`, which then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledHeaderBar()`, with the `FirstName` returned from the previous calls. 
3. `DetailedInfoSection` creates a new `HeaderBar` and sets it to be the new `DetailedHeaderBar` to be displayed.
4. `StudentCard` will create a new `ProfileContent` with the `Student`. 
5. The `ProfileContent` constructor calls `Student#getName()`, `Student#getPhone()`, `Student#getEmail()`, `Student#getAddress()` which returns the name, phone, email, and address of the student.
6. `StudentCard` then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledContent()`, which then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledContent()`, with the `ProfileContent` created from the previous calls. 
7. `DetailedInfoSection` sets it to be the new `DetailedContent` to be displayed.

`GeneralHomeworkContent`,  `GeneralLessonsContent`, `GeneralExamsContent` are further extended by subclasses:

* `EmptyHomeworkContent` and `FilledHomeworkContent` extend `GeneralHomeworkContent`, representing the situation where the `Student` has `Homework` and where the `Student` has no `Homework` respectively. 

  Specifically, `FilledHomeworkContent` has `HomeworkListPanel` with `HomeworkCard` on it, showing all homework of a `Student` and a `HomeworkPieChart`, reflecting the ratio of completed and pending `Homework` of  a `Student.`

   Given below is the partial class diagram of `Ui` component related to Filled Homework Content.

  <img src="images/UiFilledHomeworkContent.png" width="600" height="600"/>

  Given below is the sequence diagram showing how the action of clicking the `HomeworkButton` of a `Student` creates a new `HomeworkContent` for that particular student

  <img src="images/HomeworkClickSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" height="600" />

  **How the Filled Homework Section is created when Homework Button is Clicked**

  1. Based on the graph above, after the user clicks the view homework button, `StudentCard` calls `Student#getFullName()`, which then calls `Name#getFirstName()`.
  2. `StudentCard` then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledHeaderBar()`, which then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledHeaderBar()`, with the `FirstName` returned from the previous calls. 
  3. `DetailedInfoSection` creates a new `HeaderBar` and sets it to be the new `DetailedHeaderBar` to be displayed.
  4. If `Student` does not have `Homework`, `StudentCard` will create a new `EmptyHomeorkContent` with the `Student`. 
  5. If `Student` have `Homework`, `StudentCard` will create a new `FilledHomeorkContent` with the `Student`. 
  6. The `FilledHomeworkContent` constructor calls `Student#getName()`, `Student#getHomeworkPiechartData()`, `Student#HomeworkList()`, which returns the name, Pie Chart Data, and Homework List.
  7. `StudentCard` then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledContent()`, which then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledContent()`, with the `EmptyHomeworkContent`  or `FilledHomeworkContent`created from the previous calls. 
  8. `DetailedInfoSection` sets it to be the new `DetailedContent` to be displayed.

* `EmptyLessonsContent` and `FilledLessonsContent` extend `GeneralLessonsContent`, representing the situation where the `Student` has `Lessons` and where the `Student` has no `Lessons` respectively. 

  Specifically, `FilledLessonsContent` has `PastLessonsListPanel` with `LessonCard` on it, showing all past `Lessons` of a `Student` and `UpcomingLessonsListPanel` with `LessonCard` on it, showing all upcoming `Lessons` of a `Student`.

   Given below is the partial class diagram of `Ui` component related to Filled Lessons Content.

  <img src="images/UiFilledLessonsContent.png" width="600" height="600"/>

  Given below is the sequence diagram showing how the action of clicking the `LessonsButton` of a `Student` creates a new `LessonsContent` for that particular student

  <img src="images/LessonsClickSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" height="600" />

  **How the Filled Lessons Section is created when Lessons Button is Clicked**

  1. Based on the graph above, after the user clicks the view lessons button, `StudentCard` calls `Student#getFullName()`, which then calls `Name#getFirstName()`.
  2. `StudentCard` then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledHeaderBar()`, which then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledHeaderBar()`, with the `FirstName` returned from the previous calls. 
  3. `DetailedInfoSection` creates a new `HeaderBar` and sets it to be the new `DetailedHeaderBar` to be displayed.
  4. If `Student` does not have `Lessons`, `StudentCard` will create a new `EmptyLessonsContent` with the `Student`. 
  5. If `Student` have `Lessons`, `StudentCard` will create a new `FilledLessonsContent` with the `Student`. 
  6. The `FilledLessonsContent` constructor calls `Student#getName()`, `Student#getPastLessonsList()`, `Student#UpcomingLessonsList()`, which returns the name, Past Lessons List, and Upcoming Lessons List.
  7. `StudentCard` then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledContent()`, which then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledContent()`, with the `EmptyLessonsContent`  or `FilledLessonsContent`created from the previous calls. 
  8. `DetailedInfoSection` sets it to be the new `DetailedContent` to be displayed.

* `EmptyExamsContent` and `FilledExamsContent` extend `GeneralExamsContent`, representing the situation where the `Student` has `Exams` and where the `Student` has no `Exams` respectively. 

  Specifically, `FilledExamsContent` has `AllExamsListPanel` with `ExamCard` on it, showing all past `Exams` of a `Student` and `UpcomingLessonsListPanel` with `ExamCard` on it, showing the most recent three upcoming `Exams` of a `Student`

  Given below is the partial class diagram of `Ui` component related to Filled Exams Content

  <img src="images/UiFilledExamsContent.png" width="600" height="600"/>

  Given below is the sequence diagram showing how the action of clicking the `ExamsButton` of a `Student` creates a new `ExamsContent` for that particular student

  <img src="images/ExamsClickSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" height="600" />

  **How the Filled Exams Section is created when Exams Button is Clicked**

  1. Based on the graph above, after the user clicks the view exams button, `StudentCard` calls `Student#getFullName()`, which then calls `Name#getFirstName()`.
  2. `StudentCard` then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledHeaderBar()`, which then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledHeaderBar()`, with the `FirstName` returned from the previous calls. 
  3. `DetailedInfoSection` creates a new `HeaderBar` and sets it to be the new `DetailedHeaderBar` to be displayed.
  4. If `Student` does not have `Exams`, `StudentCard` will create a new `EmptyExamsContent` with the `Student`. 
  5. If `Student` have `Exams`, `StudentCard` will create a new `FilledExamsContent` with the `Student`. 
  6. The `FilledExamssContent` constructor calls `Student#getName()`, `Student#ExamsList()`, `Student#UpcomingExamsList()`, which returns the name, All Exams List, Upcoming Exams List.
  7. `StudentCard` then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledContent()`, which then calls `DetailedInfoSection#SetDeatiledContent()`, with the `EmptyExamsContent`  or `FilledExamsContent`created from the previous calls. 
  8. `DetailedInfoSection` sets it to be the new `DetailedContent` to be displayed.

The following activity diagram summarises how the UI responds to an click button command.

<img src="images/ClickButtonActivityDiagram.png" height="600" width="1000"/>

####  Alternatives considered for Quick Access Buttons

While designing the Quick Access Buttons on the Student Card, several alternatives were considered to ensure an optimal user experience.

* **Alternative 1 :** One alternative that was considered was to have a pop-up window for each button click event. However, this alternative was ultimately rejected due to its potential drawbacks.
  * Pros: 
    * Provides a clear and separate window to display the detailed information for each button.
    * Can be designed to provide a consistent layout and structure for displaying the detailed information.
    * Can be a good choice if there is a need to provide a lot of detailed information for each button click.
    * Can be helpful in providing a larger viewing area for the detailed information.
  * Cons: 
    * Requires additional user interaction to close the pop-up window, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
    * Can be less optimized for a command-line interface (CLI), where users prefer quick and direct access to information.
    * Can lead to a cluttered user interface if multiple pop-up windows are open at the same time.
    * Can require additional resources and time to design and implement compared to other alternatives.


### Create Lesson feature
the `new-lesson` command adds a Lesson (specified with student name, lesson name, start time, and end time) to a particular Student. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command works:

Step1. The user inputs a `new-lesson` command with parameters name/John, lesson/Math lesson, start/2023-05-01 1200, and end/2023-05-01 1400. When Logic is called upon to execute a command, it uses the AddressBookParser class to parse the user command. The parser recognises the command words and calls the CreateLessonCommandParser.

Step2. The `CreateLessonCommandParser` recognises each parameter passed in.

Step3. `CreateLessonCommandParser` creates a new `CreateLessonCommand` with appropriate parameters.

Step4. `CreateLessonCommand` is executed by LogicManager, creating a new Lesson object and then calls the `addLesson` method in Student

Step5. The Student calls the `addLesson` method in the UniqueLessonList, adding the Lesson to his list of Lessons.

Step6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute("new-lesson name/John lesson/Math lesson start/2023-05-01 1200 end/2023-05-01 1400") API call.

<img src="images/CreateLessonSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a CreateLessonCommand:

<img src="images/CreateLessonAD.png" width="600" />


### School and GradeLevel Fields

#### v1.2 Implementation of School and GradeLevel Fields

As of v1.2, School and GradeLevel fields are parsed via the `AddCommandParser` class. `AddCommandParser#parse` method 
checks whether the prefixes for school and/or gradelevel are present, and if present, then adds it to 
the new student as `Tags`. They are then treated throughout the program the same as other `Tags`.

It has been implemented this way for its ease of implementation, and because it shows the School and GradeLevel 
in the Students list view, without having to open up the student's profile.

#### New Implementation of School and GradeLevel Fields in v1.3

In v1.3, we are adding School and GradeLevel as separate fields in the Student's profile, instead of `Tags`. These will 
show up in the Student Profile view.

This is to reduce the number of Tags placed under each Student's name in the Students list view, making it look less 
cluttered.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
